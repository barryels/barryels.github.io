<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a (mostly) web developer who is passionate about building a better web for everyone, and consequently the businesses that power it.</p>
  <p>Whether through technical innovation, solid user experience or process management.</p>
  <p>I've had the fortune of many years of experience building technical solutions using a wide range of technologies, from Actionscript (way-back machine alert) through to Ruby on Rails.</p>
  <p>My core focus of late, has been front-end development, as that is where the rubber hits the road in terms of good or bad user experience.</p>
