#### Featured Project: Healthcare Web Application

As technical lead for a web-based single page application (one part of a larger system), my role involves mentoring 3 front-end developers, with a focus on inspiring them to appreciate the principles that support delivering a high quality product that users enjoy interacting with. My initial involvement was in designing and implementing the high-level application architecture (components, API integration adapter, state management) and the team processes (source control workflows, TDD/BDD, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring).

I introduced pair programming practices to help alleviate key person dependencies and foster more collaboration and innovation within the front-end development team.

I introduced, promoted and contributed to a product-wide architecture decision log, which is a valuable source of structured institutional knowledge. I introduced automated Gherkin testing, with the aim of aligning QA, Dev, BA and other stakeholders around a common user-centred language, that also happens to be machine-verifiable.
