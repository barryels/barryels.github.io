# Compliance Bias (Obstacle)

## Description

AI is deliberately trained to be helpful and compliant above all else. It will say "Sure thing, boss" even when your request makes no sense in its universe.

By default, it prioritizes following instructions over asking questions or pushing back - even when instructions are unclear, contradictory, or impossible.

## Impact

- Accepts nonsensical requests instead of clarifying
- Attempts impossible tasks rather than explaining limitations
- Silently misinterprets rather than questioning your assumptions
- Creates elaborate workarounds instead of suggesting better approaches
- Combined with Black Box AI, makes misalignment invisible until things break
