## Why a blog?

It's 2024, where everyone and their pet has a blog, why would the world need yet another?

Well, put simply, this blog is more for me than it is for you, dear reader. It's a way for me to use writing as a tool for thinking. If there's something valuable here for you, then that's awesome! If there isn't, then I hope I didn't add to the noise, nor waste too much of your time.

I also just want to produce content, rather than just consume it, again, mostly for my own edification, but if I can help someone else along the way, then that's a win-win.
