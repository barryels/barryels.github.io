## TL;DR

When attempting to understand complex systems, there is a paradox: "All models are wrong, but some are useful." – George Box, this statement encapsulates the inherent imperfections of models of reality while highlighting their indispensable value in certain contexts. It is key to first understand and internalise the limitations of a given model, then use the real world to update your model incrementally as new data is captured.

## What are models?

A model is an abstraction of reality, it's a shortcut to understanding. For example: If you press a key on a keyboard and a character appears on a screen, it's enough to label that interaction as "typing". It is not necessary to explain every single underlying event; from the neurological signalling required to coordinate the depressing of the key, through to the bits of data that passed through the CPU to realise the updating of the pixels on a screen. We just call it "typing". Do we lose some data by discarding those detailed events? Yes. Are those detailed events relevant for the level of decision making that's required for a given context? Maybe.

## Why they're wrong

In the pursuit of understanding complex systems, we often aim for both accuracy and precision in our models. However, no model can perfectly replicate the intricacies of the real world, as it is inevitably an abstraction – a simplification of the real world.

Models are constructed based on assumptions, simplifications, and a finite set of variables. These simplifications inherently introduce errors, and as the complexity of the system increases, so does the divergence between the model and reality. Recognising this fallacy is the first step towards a more nuanced appreciation of the modeling process.

## Why they're useful

While perfection may not be unattainable, models still provide a huge amount of value. Models are powerful tools for understanding, prediction and decision making. The key lies in their ability to approximate reality well enough for the intended purpose. Rather than viewing imperfections as failures, they become opportunities for refinement and enhancement. Through iterative adjustments, models can better align with the ever-evolving understanding of a system. Adapting models based on real-world feedback and new data ensures their ongoing relevance and effectiveness.

## So... First-Principles-All-the-Things, right?

Maybe. Context will dictate the level of detail required. There are some fundamental truths that can be relied on that don't need to be re-thought or re-calculated at every iteration. Knowing which layer to stop at is the trick.
