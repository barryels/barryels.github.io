## TL;DR

When attempting to understand complex systems, there is a paradox: "All models are wrong, but some are useful." – George Box, this statement encapsulates the inherent imperfections of models of reality while highlighting their indispensable value in certain contexts. It is key to first understand and internalise the limitations of a given model, then use the real world to update your model incrementally as new data is captured.

## "All models are wrong, ..."

In the pursuit of understanding complex systems, we often aim for both accuracy and precision in our models. However, no model can perfectly replicate the intricacies of the real world, as it is inevitably an abstraction – a simplification of the real world.

Models are constructed based on assumptions, simplifications, and a finite set of variables. These simplifications inherently introduce errors, and as the complexity of the system increases, so does the divergence between the model and reality. Recognising this fallacy is the first step towards a more nuanced appreciation of the modeling process.

## "... but some are useful"

While perfection may not be unattainable, models still provide utility. Models serve as powerful tools for understanding and prediction. The key lies in their ability to approximate reality well enough for the intended purpose. Rather than viewing imperfections as failures, they become opportunities for refinement and enhancement. Through iterative adjustments, models can better align with the ever-evolving understanding of a system. Adapting models based on real-world feedback and new data ensures their ongoing relevance and effectiveness.
